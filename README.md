# Frontend Mentor - Interactive card details form

This is a solution to the Interactive card details form challenge(https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-card-details-form-XpS8cKZDWw). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## Overview

  - Frontend Mentor | Interactive card details form
  - The challenge consisted in replicating card details form for a desktop and mobile view perspective. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page. Receive an error message when the form is submitted any input field is empty or if the inputs are not formatted correctly.
  - Here it is two screenshots taken from desktop and mobile perspective;

- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS + Javascript
  - Oh my god, what a challenge this was! This one was, by some margin, the hardest one I did so far. To figure out the design and the Javascript logic in it was very hard for me. I know this was is not perfect, but I had to post it in order to ask for opinions. 
  - The design and the logic I knew I had to do in this project was threatening me at first. However, I also knew this project would get all of me and it really did. It got me working for several hours and days to complete. At first, the design, it took me some time to pull off, especially due to the cards are like "floating" on the screen. I tried to be as much simpler as I could and I used a lot of flex containers and standard alignment methods to make it work. The responsiveness was another thing to be considered here, were the "break" into the mobile version was tricky. Thank god there is a display grid in it, so It's easier to flip the design. However, the cards needed to be adjusted manually and, to be honest, I am not 100% satisfied with the result. As my goal is to keep learning, I opted to move one as is.
  - The Javascript part was incredibly difficult to figure out. However, after finishing it, I noticed that I learned A LOT from it. I was always afraid in using functions (I don't know why) and this challenge got me out of it. There are probably many and better ways to approach this, using objects or arrays, for example, but I tried using functions and "if" statements. I know I have to do A LOT of practice to master all, but I think I am improving each day. As for the challenge, at first, I knew I had to select all the interactive elements of the page. Once I did it, I had to treat each one of the inputs when the user presses a key. So, I did it using a function for each event listened. Itâ€™s not the deepest treatment there is, but I believe, in general, get the job done. I am not sure if I used the best regex pattern to treat number and letters input, as there are some exceptions that these fields are accepting, like "-" character. After that, I just had to select the divs in the card images section to show the inputted values. So, after finishing all the treatments, I had to check the whole form when submitted. I did it using a function and shown the errors to the user. I used a function from a previous challenge and It worked ok. The validation also took me some time and patience to conclude. By the end of this project, I just wanted to deliver it to get feedbacks from others. So, after a reasonably result, I finally finished it.
